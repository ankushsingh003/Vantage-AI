        Task: Extract/Synthesize a detailed, realistic dataset for the '{industry}' industry for '{quarter} {year}'.

        CRITICAL RULES — NEVER BREAK THESE:
        - Use ONLY REAL, NAMED companies (e.g., "Heidelberg Materials", "ExxonMobil", "JPMorgan Chase"). 
        - DO NOT use placeholder names like "Market Peer B", "Niche Player D", "Global Leader A", or any similar generic names.
        - Include 12 to 15 companies representing the full competitive landscape (from dominant leaders to mid-tier players).
        - Each company MUST have a realistic "market_share_pct" (percentage of total industry revenue/market cap) that sums to roughly 100%.
        - Financial figures must be realistic and in USD millions, based on publicly known data or plausible estimates.
        - Industry Lens: {industry_hint}
        - The data MUST reflect {quarter} seasonality and macro-economic conditions.
